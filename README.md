# Regression_analysis
Prediction of CPU job waiting time using regression techniques and time series analysis.

Usage of various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the waiting time for a CPU job based on past data from Auver Grid dataset.
The models used are:
*  Linear Regression
*  Decision Tree
*  Randomforest Regressor 
*  Support Vector Regressor(SVR)
*  K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN)
*  XGBoost Regressor
*  Recurrent Neural Network(Long short-term memory)
*  Artificial Neural Network
*  Multi Layer Perceptron
